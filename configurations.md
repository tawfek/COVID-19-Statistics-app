# ü¶æ Configurations

You can modify the languages, add a new language, change the default language or modify the languages, enable|disable the cache, and add or delete supported countries.



## üåê Adding a new language

the best way to learn is to show an example, in this example we will add the Chinese language to our app, please follow the steps below :



1- go-to the [languages folder](https://github.com/tawfek/covid19-statistics/tree/master/src/localization/languages) and make a new file named with the language name. then change its contents.

2- import the language you added to the [i18n file](src/localization/i18n.js)

3- lastly let's add the language to the settings menu, we do that by modifying the [languages.js file](src/localization/languages.js)

Please note: react-timeago has its own languages you can find the list of supported

languages here [react-timeago](https://github.com/nmn/react-timeago/tree/master/src/language-strings)
{% endhint %}

4- Now your application is supporting a new language ü•≥ how easy was that?

## ü™ô Configuring cahce

The Cache is very important for the performance and for lowering the usage of APIs by making fewer requests. I use [phpfastcache](https://www.phpfastcache.com) for caching, the cache will be saved as a file. you can change it with Redis or any other methods you want.&#x20;

the cache is enabled by default, you can disable it or change the folder of caching from the [.env file](api/.env.example)
